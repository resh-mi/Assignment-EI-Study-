Solution to the Assignment of Ei Study
Overview
This repository contains my solution to the first exercise of the Ei Study assignment, where I demonstrate six different use cases of software design patterns in Java. Each use case aligns with global best practices for clarity, modularity, and performance.

Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

Behavioral Patterns

Observer Pattern: A weather station notifies multiple display devices of temperature changes.
Strategy Pattern: A shopping cart enables the user to select between payment methods.
Creational Patterns

Singleton Pattern: Manages a single database connection throughout the application lifecycle.
Factory Pattern: Dynamically creates different types of notifications (SMS, Email).
Structural Patterns

Adapter Pattern: Allows a media player to handle multiple formats like MP3.
Decorator Pattern: Adds optional features (e.g., milk) to a coffee order dynamically.
Each pattern adheres to high coding standards, ensuring easy maintenance, strong error handling, and smooth runtime performance.

Implementation Highlights
1. Behavioral Patterns
Observer Pattern:

A WeatherStation object notifies its subscribers (PhoneDisplay) whenever the temperature changes.
This pattern helps showcase how real-time updates can be propagated to multiple observers seamlessly.
Strategy Pattern:

The ShoppingCart class allows the user to select from different payment strategies (CreditCard, PayPal).
Enables runtime switching between algorithms, showcasing flexibility in handling payment processes.
2. Creational Patterns
Singleton Pattern:

DatabaseConnection ensures a single connection instance, optimizing resource usage and maintaining global access throughout the application.
Demonstrates how to efficiently manage shared resources.
Factory Pattern:

A NotificationFactory creates different notification objects (SMSNotification, EmailNotification) based on user input.
This pattern keeps object creation logic centralized and scalable, supporting easy future extensions.
3. Structural Patterns
Adapter Pattern:

Adapts MediaPlayer to play different media formats using a MediaAdapter.
Highlights the ability to integrate and adapt incompatible interfaces for seamless usage.
Decorator Pattern:

CoffeeDecorator dynamically adds functionalities (like MilkDecorator) to SimpleCoffee, demonstrating how objects can gain new features without altering their structure.
This pattern emphasizes flexibility in extending an object's behavior.
How to Run the Code
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Assignment-EI-Study.git
Navigate to the Desired Pattern's Directory:
bash
Copy code
cd Assignment-EI-Study/src/behavioral/observer
Compile the Java Files:
bash
Copy code
javac *.java
Run the Main Class:
bash
Copy code
java ObserverPatternDemo
(Replace ObserverPatternDemo with the corresponding main class for each pattern)
Design Principles & Best Practices
Separation of Concerns: Each class is in its own file with well-defined responsibilities.
Logging & Exception Handling: Added logs and validation to track execution and handle edge cases.
Modularity & Scalability: Code is structured to allow easy enhancements, additions, and changes to each design pattern.
Optimized Performance: Ensures that the program runs efficiently without unnecessary resource consumption.
Reflection
This exercise has allowed me to explore different design patterns and their practical applications. By implementing these patterns, Iâ€™ve aimed to showcase an understanding of how to solve real-world problems using design principles, ensuring code is maintainable, extendable, and efficient.

Feel free to explore the code, run different patterns, and reach out if you have any questions or need further details!
